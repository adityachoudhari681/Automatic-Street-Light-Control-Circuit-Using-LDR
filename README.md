In this project, I designed and implemented an innovative Automatic Street Light Control Circuit Prototype using LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to efficiently manage the operation of street lights ( Here I used a single LED in place of actual street light)based on ambient light levels. 

The primary objective of the project was to create an intelligent system that automatically turns street lights on at dusk and off at dawn, thereby eliminating the need for manual intervention and reducing unnecessary energy consumption during daylight hours.
